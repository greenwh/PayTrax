# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to PayTrax! This guide will get you running your first payroll in just a few minutes.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Company

Before you do anything else, you need to tell the program about your company and pay schedule.

1.  Click on the **Settings** tab.
2.  Under `Company Settings`, fill in your Company Name and the current Tax Year.
3.  The most important fields are `Pay Frequency` (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly) and the `Tax Year First Pay Period Start Date`. The application uses these to automatically generate all your pay periods for the year.
4.  The application saves automatically as you make changes.

### Step 2: Add Your First Employee

Now, let's add an employee to the system.

1.  While still in the **Settings** tab, scroll down to the `Employee Management` card.
2.  Fill out the "Add New Employee" form with the employee's name, hourly rate, and tax withholding rates.
3.  Click the **Save Employee** button.

### Step 3: Run Your First Payroll

Time to calculate a paycheck!

1.  Click on the **Dashboard** tab.
2.  Using the dropdowns at the top, select the Employee you just added and the Current Pay Period you want to process.
3.  The "Enter Hours for Period" card will appear. Enter the Regular Hours, Overtime Hours, etc., for that employee.
4.  As you enter hours, the payroll details below will update in real-time, showing you the Gross Pay, Taxes, and Net Pay.
5.  That's it! The payroll is calculated and saved. You can now view the details in the `Pay Periods` tab or generate a formal payslip from the `Pay Stub` tab.

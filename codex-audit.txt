• Findings

  - High – Payroll tax withholding is implemented as a set of flat percentages entered per employee (fedTaxRate,
    stateTaxRate, localTaxRate) and applied directly to gross wages (PayTrax/js/logic.js:203-215, PayTrax/js/
    logic.js:505-517). There is no concept of IRS Publication 15‑T tables, filing status, allowances, supplemental
    wage rules, pre‑tax deductions, or state-specific brackets. In a professional system this produces materially wrong
    net pay and remittance amounts for every employee unless the user guesses the exact effective percentage for each
    period, which is not compliant or auditable.
  - High – The system defines Social Security, Medicare, FUTA wage bases and Additional Medicare thresholds (PayTrax/
    js/state.js:34-41, PayTrax/js/logic.js:9), but the actual payroll calculation never consults them (PayTrax/js/
    logic.js:203-209). As a result FICA, FUTA, SUTA and Additional Medicare continue to be calculated on every dollar
    earned, even after employees exceed the statutory caps. Reports such as the 941 attempt to cap wages retrospectively
    (PayTrax/js/logic.js:869-959), so the deposit reports/W‑2 summaries will never tie to the amounts actually withheld
    or posted to the bank register. This creates guaranteed mismatches with IRS/state filings and will over‑withhold
    from employees once they pass the caps.
  - High – Running payroll automatically books a single bank-register debit equal to gross pay plus all tax amounts
    (PayTrax/js/logic.js:245-255). That treats employee withholdings and employer taxes as if they left cash
    immediately with the paycheck, rather than remaining in liability accounts until deposits are made, and it never
    creates separate transactions when the tax payments actually occur. A professional ledger should record net-pay
    disbursements and track tax liabilities/deposits separately; the current approach double-counts the cash outflow and
    makes reconciliation against actual bank activity impossible.
  - High – All payroll data (employee PII, pay history, bank register, tax settings) is persisted directly in browser
    IndexedDB/localStorage with no encryption, access control, backup, or multi-user authentication (PayTrax/js/
    state.js:63-147). For a payroll system this violates basic security/compliance expectations (SOC 2, HIPAA, state
    privacy laws) and makes it trivial for anyone with browser access to exfiltrate or tamper with payroll records.
    A production-grade solution needs a secured server-side store with encryption at rest, authentication, and audit
    logging.
  - Medium – The employee data model only captures name, address, and flat rates (PayTrax/js/logic.js:505-517). There
    is no place to store legally required identifiers (SSN/EIN), work locations, filing statuses, benefit elections,
    garnishments, or residency data, so the system cannot generate valid W‑2s/1099s, state unemployment filings, or
    multi-jurisdiction taxes. This also prevents supporting routine small-business scenarios like multi-state employees,
    pre-tax benefits, or court-ordered deductions.

  Open Questions / Assumptions

  - Are there plans to capture W‑4/W‑2 data (filing status, dependents, SSN) and jurisdictional information needed for
    compliance, or is the goal intentionally limited to “toy” calculations?
  - How are tax deposits actually executed? If external systems handle payments, what data exchange is expected so that
    liabilities and deposits can be reconciled accurately?

  Change Summary

  - No code changes were made; this was a code-quality and compliance review.
